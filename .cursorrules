# Cursor Rules for Repeater Project
# Rhythmic Semantic Visualization Paradigm
# BCI-NE Lab, University of Essex

## Environment Management
- Always use dedicated conda environment: "repeat"
- If conda env "repeat" doesn't exist, create it before running any Python code
- Activate conda environment before executing scripts: `conda activate repeat`
- Never run code outside the conda environment

## Version Control
- Use git for all commits and backups
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Maintain clean git history
- Use .gitignore appropriately for data files and temporary outputs

## Script Execution
- Use CLI commands for consistent script launching
- Never hardcode paths - use dynamic pathing with pathlib or os.path
- All scripts should be executable from command line with proper argument parsing

## Code Quality Standards
- Only implement changes that follow best practices
- For novel work, conduct research first to make well-informed decisions
- Keep codebase clean and intelligible
- Remove repeated, redundant, inefficient, legacy, and clutter code while retaining functionality
- Prefer many small functions/classes over large cumbersome functions
- Make code modular, open, and easily modifiable/portable

## Project Structure
- Silo specific aspects in dedicated folders with:
  - Dedicated scripts for operations/launching
  - Function banks for reusable code
- Keep experiment code separate from analysis code
- Maintain clear separation of concerns

## Character Encoding
- Zero emojis or special characters in codebase
- Use ASCII-compatible characters only
- Avoid Unicode characters that could cause mapping errors

## Configuration Management
- Use dedicated config file (experiment_config.py) for all paradigm parameters:
  - Fixation cross duration
  - Window background color
  - Timing parameters
  - Concept lists
  - Visual/audio parameters
- Never hardcode experimental parameters in main scripts
- Make configuration easily adaptable without touching core code

## Project-Specific Guidelines
- This is a BCI experiment adaptation from speech imagery to semantic visualization
- Maintain compatibility with existing analysis pipeline (tangent space logistic regression)
- Follow rhythmic protocol structure (0.8s beep intervals, 8 beeps)
- Ensure EEG trigger compatibility
- Save trial data in standardized format (JSON + NumPy)

## Dependencies
- Primary: PsychoPy (visual, core, sound, event, parallel)
- Data: numpy, json
- File handling: pathlib
- Date/time: datetime

## Code Organization
- Main experiment: rhythmic_semantic_enhanced.py (full-featured)
- Simple version: rhythmic_semantic_visualization.py (testing)
- Configuration: experiment_config.py (all parameters)
- Examples: examples/ folder for reference implementations
- Documentation: README_semantic_paradigm.md
